    The user may have specific requests. Make sure that you accomplish their requests which are {specifics}. 
    YOU MUST FULFILL THEIR SPECIFIC REQUEST. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH NOT DOING IT IF THEY ASK FOR A DRIVER OR TEAM THAT IS NO LONGER ON THE GRID.
    Make sure to only return drivers who are currently on the grid. You can get that information from here: {allCurrentData["drivers"]} and at {currentDriversURL}.
    Also make sure you have the right team names, which you can find here: {allCurrentData["constructors"]} and also {currentTeamsURL}.
    You can also data/statistics from F1 fantasy to help recommend the teams. you can find this at: {all_fantasy_data['drivers_data']} for driver and constructor data at {all_fantasy_data['constructors_data']}.
    **The name gives you the information about the driver/constructor, the 'curvalue' tells you the cost of the driver/constructor, and lastly 'statvalue' represents the points a driver or constructor gets statistically.**
